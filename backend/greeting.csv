1371,1371,the tv news doesn't tell us the race anymore.,greeting
1372,1372,of course not. that would be racist.,greeting
1373,1373,but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?,greeting
1374,1374,don't ask me.,greeting
1375,1375,don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.,greeting
1376,1376,but i don't have a tissue.,greeting
1377,1377,then go find a tissue in the bathroom.,greeting
1378,1378,i didn't have time to get one from there.,greeting
1379,1379,your sleeves are not tissues.,greeting
1380,1380,"but mom, all my friends use their sleeves.",greeting
1381,1381,that doesn't make it right.,greeting
1382,1382,i saw dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.,greeting
1383,1383,i will talk to your father about that.,greeting
1384,1384,i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.,greeting
1385,1385,your daddy was a good little boy.,greeting
1386,1386,i'm worried.,greeting
1387,1387,worried about what?,greeting
1388,1388,i'm getting married.,greeting
1389,1389,"you should be happy, not worried.",greeting

1393,1393,are you going to start a family?,greeting

1395,1395,that sounds wonderful.,greeting
1396,1396,except we can't afford it!,greeting
1397,1397,i don't get art.,greeting
1398,1398,or artists.,greeting
1399,1399,they're in a different world.,greeting
1400,1400,i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.,greeting
1401,1401,the artist said the jar was both full and empty.,greeting
1402,1402,but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?,greeting
1403,1403,artists see things differently.,greeting
1404,1404,did you ever see anything that picasso painted?,greeting
1405,1405,of course! he's world famous.,greeting
1406,1406,did he ever take art lessons?,greeting
1407,1407,i can't believe it. i drew paintings like that in third grade.,greeting
1408,1408,what's the point?,greeting
1409,1409,the point of what?,greeting
1410,1410,of living.,greeting
1411,1411,"who knows? you live, and then you die.",greeting
1412,1412,we must be here for some reason.,greeting
1413,1413,maybe we're here to have fun.,greeting
1414,1414,then why aren't i having fun?,greeting
1415,1415,because you're thinking too much.,greeting
1416,1416,so i should stop thinking?,greeting
1417,1417,stop thinking about what the point is.,greeting
1418,1418,okay. i'll start thinking about having some fun.,greeting
1419,1419,beer is a powerful drug.,greeting
1420,1420,so are cigarettes.,greeting
1421,1421,which would you prefer?,greeting
1422,1422,what do you mean?,greeting
1423,1423,"when you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.",greeting
1424,1424,i could pick only one or the other?,greeting
1425,1425,"yes. nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.",greeting
1426,1426,"boy, that's a tough one.",greeting
1427,1427,"what's so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes.",greeting
1428,1428,but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.,greeting
1429,1429,"well, you can't have everything.",greeting
1430,1430,my pants have a hole in the front pocket.,greeting
1431,1431,you shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.,greeting
1432,1432,yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.,greeting
1433,1433,lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.,greeting
1434,1434,who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?,greeting
1435,1435,"criminals, of course.",greeting
1436,1436,"anyway, i have to fix the hole.",greeting
1437,1437,you can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.,greeting
1438,1438,tell me about this patch.,greeting
1439,1439,the patch has glue. the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.,greeting
1440,1440,that sounds a lot easier than sewing.,greeting
1441,1441,do you know any good jokes?,greeting
1442,1442,i can't remember jokes.,greeting
1443,1443,neither can i.,greeting
1444,1444,they go in one ear and out the other.,greeting
1445,1445,who makes up all these jokes?,greeting
1446,1446,who knows? but there must be a hundred new ones every day.,greeting
1447,1447,"yes, just in english alone.",greeting
1448,1448,i wonder if every language has jokes.,greeting
1449,1449,of course! people everywhere like good jokes.,greeting
1450,1450,what do you think people joke about the most?,greeting
1451,1451,i think most jokes are about women.,greeting
1452,1452,you're very lucky.,greeting
1453,1453,why do you say that?,greeting
1454,1454,you speak two languages.,greeting
1455,1455,"well, my english isn't perfect.",greeting
1456,1456,no one speaks perfect english.,greeting
1457,1457,maybe i will be the first!,greeting
1458,1458,i've been thinking about learning spanish.,greeting
1459,1459,spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach you.,greeting
1460,1460,how long will it take me to learn?,greeting
1461,1461,i think it will only take you a year or two.,greeting
1462,1462,how soon can we begin?,greeting
1463,1463,do you know what today is?,greeting
1464,1464,"yes, it's april 22.",greeting
1465,1465,it's more than just a date.,greeting
1466,1466,is it your birthday or anniversary?,greeting
1467,1467,"no, it's earth day.",greeting
1468,1468,what's that?,greeting
1469,1469,it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.,greeting
1470,1470,"oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?",greeting
1471,1471,"yes. we need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.",greeting
1472,1472,how about if i take shorter showers?,greeting
1473,1473,"that's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.",greeting
1474,1474,poetry sucks.,greeting
1475,1475,i don't know anyone who likes it.,greeting
1476,1476,"some of it is okay, i guess.",greeting
1477,1477,"yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.",greeting
1478,1478,"like ""one, two, buckle my shoe.""",greeting
1479,1479,but people still write poems.,greeting
1480,1480,no one makes any money at it.,greeting
1481,1481,shakespeare was a poet.,greeting
1482,1482,did he get rich from his poetry?,greeting
1483,1483,probably not.,greeting
1484,1484,poems are a little bit like songs.,greeting
1485,1485,how smart are you?,greeting
1486,1486,i don't know. i think i'm average.,greeting
1487,1487,did you ever take an iq test?,greeting
1488,1488,"no, i never did. all i know is that i got a's and b's in school.",greeting
1489,1489,i wish i was really smart.,greeting
1490,1490,don't be ridiculous.,greeting
1491,1491,what do you mean?,greeting
1492,1492,"if you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.",greeting
1493,1493,don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?,greeting
1494,1494,it must be very lonely.,greeting
1495,1495,why's that?,greeting
1496,1496,i missed the tv news last night. what was on?,greeting
1497,1497,nothing that would pass as news.,greeting
1498,1498,what's the weather going to be like this weekend?,greeting
1499,1499,"i don't know. whenever the weather comes on, i switch channels.",greeting
1500,1500,what was the lead story on the news?,greeting
1501,1501,some actress was in court for driving without a license.,greeting

1510,1510,my wife and i will be cremated.,greeting
1511,1511,are you going to be buried next to each other?,greeting
1512,1512,"oh, no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.",greeting
1513,1513,you're not going to be buried?,greeting
1514,1514,a coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.,greeting
1515,1515,"yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.",greeting
1516,1516,children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.,greeting
1517,1517,"that's true. a cemetery is for dead people, not living people.",greeting
1518,1518,did you wipe your feet? ,greeting
1519,1519,"yes, of course i wiped my feet.",greeting
1520,1520,then why is there mud on the carpet?,greeting
1521,1521,i don't know. it's not my mud.,greeting
1522,1522,"well, someone brought it into the house.",greeting
1523,1523,look at the bottom of my shoesÂ—they're clean.,greeting
1524,1524,of course they're clean. you left all the mud on the carpet.,greeting
1525,1525,"okay, i'll get the vacuum cleaner.",greeting
1526,1526,don't vacuum it now.,greeting

2276,2276,did you have a date friday night?,greeting
2277,2277,"yes, in fact, i did.",greeting
2278,2278,who did you go out with?,greeting
2279,2279,a man i met in a coffee shop.,greeting
2280,2280,where did you go?,greeting
2281,2281,we went to a nice restaurant.,greeting
2282,2282,anywhere else?,greeting
2283,2283,then we went to a jazz club.,greeting
2284,2284,that sounds like a nice date.,greeting
2285,2285,"yes, it was pleasant.",greeting
2286,2286,but you won't date him again?,greeting
2287,2287,i had the worst date the other night.,greeting
2288,2288,what happened?,greeting
2289,2289,"first of all, he was half an hour late.",greeting
2290,2290,that's not a good start.,greeting
2291,2291,then he didn't bother to apologize.,greeting
2292,2292,that's rude.,greeting
2293,2293,then he drove too fast to the restaurant.,greeting
2294,2294,that's dangerous.,greeting
2295,2295,i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.,greeting
2296,2296,what happened at the restaurant?,greeting
2297,2297,"we had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!",greeting
2298,2298,i don't like that man.,greeting
2299,2299,why not?,greeting
2300,2300,he's a dirty old man.,greeting
2301,2301,what do you mean?,greeting
2302,2302,"he's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.",greeting
2303,2303,"well, you can't blame a man for asking.",greeting
2304,2304,he should act his age.,greeting
2305,2305,but a lot of old people are still interested in dating.,greeting
2306,2306,they should find a nice hobby.,greeting
2307,2307,just wait until you're 50 years old.,greeting
2308,2308,dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.,greeting
2309,2309,does your girlfriend ever make you angry?,greeting
2310,2310,sometimes.,greeting
2311,2311,what does she do?,greeting
2312,2312,"just yesterday, i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.",greeting
2313,2313,that was a nice thing to say.,greeting
2314,2314,that's what i thought.,greeting
2315,2315,what did she say?,greeting
2316,2316,she laughed! she didn't believe me.,greeting
2317,2317,that wasn't very nice of her.,greeting
2318,2318,she said that nothing is more important to me than money.,greeting
2319,2319,what did you say?,greeting
2320,2320,some people have good noses.,greeting
2321,2321,i wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big.,greeting
2322,2322,i don't mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling.,greeting
2323,2323,oh. but that can be a curse.,greeting
2324,2324,"yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.",greeting
2325,2325,i'll say. my girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.,greeting
2326,2326,did she catch you using drugs?,greeting
2327,2327,sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.,greeting
2328,2328,you don't need a good nose for thatÂ—cigarettes stink.,greeting
2329,2329,"but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!",greeting
2330,2330,"boy, that is a good nose.",greeting
2331,2331,let's go out to eat.,greeting
2332,2332,that sounds like fun.,greeting
2333,2333,where do you want to go?,greeting
2334,2334,let me think a minute.,greeting
2335,2335,i feel like chinese.,greeting
2336,2336,that sounds delicious.,greeting
2337,2337,i know a good chinese restaurant.,greeting
2338,2338,how far away is it?,greeting
2339,2339,it's only 10 minutes from here.,greeting
2340,2340,do we need reservations?,greeting
2341,2341,"oh, no. we can walk right in.",greeting
2342,2342,i can't believe how long this line is.,greeting
2343,2343,"this is a popular restaurant, isn't it?",greeting
2344,2344,"yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?",greeting
2345,2345,it's the slowest hamburger in town.,greeting
2346,2346,that's because they cook it while you wait.,greeting
2347,2347,yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.,greeting
2348,2348,a great burger and great service.,greeting
2349,2349,"yes, the workers are very polite.",greeting
2350,2350,and they're clean.,greeting
2351,2351,i've been coming here for years.,greeting
2352,2352,me too.,greeting
2353,2353,lunch was delicious.,greeting
2354,2354,thank you.,greeting
2355,2355,what kind of soup was that?,greeting
2356,2356,it was tomato soup.,greeting
2357,2357,that tasted so good.,greeting
2358,2358,i put lemon and butter in it.,greeting
2359,2359,"the sandwich was good, too.",greeting
2360,2360,everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.,greeting
2361,2361,especially on toast.,greeting
2362,2362,"and the pickles were great, too.",greeting
2363,2363,tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.,greeting
2364,2364,i'm calling the waiter.,greeting
2365,2365,what's the matter?,greeting
2366,2366,this steak has too much fat.,greeting
2367,2367,what do you want the waiter to do?,greeting
2368,2368,bring me a better steak.,greeting
2369,2369,i wouldn't do that.,greeting
2370,2370,why not?,greeting
2371,2371,"they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.",greeting
2372,2372,you're crazy.,greeting
2373,2373,then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.,greeting
2374,2374,where do you get these crazy ideas?,greeting
2375,2375,let's leave.,greeting
2376,2376,but we just got here.,greeting
2377,2377,did you see the waiter's hands?,greeting
2378,2378,no.,greeting
2379,2379,he had dirty fingernails.,greeting
2380,2380,really?,greeting
2381,2381,his nails were black!,greeting
2382,2382,that's disgusting.,greeting
2383,2383,and he poured water into our glasses.,greeting
2384,2384,yuck! no water for me.,greeting
2385,2385,"i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.",greeting
2386,2386,this hot bread is delicious.,greeting
2387,2387,i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.,greeting
2388,2388,"well, i think we are paying for it.",greeting
2389,2389,no. look at the bill when we get it. there's no charge for the bread.,greeting
2390,2390,"it is delicious, especially with butter.",greeting
2391,2391,i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.,greeting
2392,2392,they probably wouldn't like that.,greeting
2393,2393,i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full.,greeting
2394,2394,then stop eating the bread!,greeting
2395,2395,"okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please.",greeting
2396,2396,"if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course.",greeting
2397,2397,is this a clean restaurant?,greeting
2398,2398,"well, the tables and chairs look okay.",greeting
2399,2399,"okay, let's sit down.",greeting
2400,2400,check out the silverware.,greeting
2401,2401,it passes inspection.,greeting
2402,2402,here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.,greeting
2403,2403,"well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it's okay to eat here.",greeting
2404,2404,you're forgetting about the bathroom.,greeting
2405,2405,i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.,greeting
2406,2406,you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?,greeting
2407,2407,"no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right now.",greeting
2408,2408,have you seen our waiter?,greeting
2409,2409,here he comes now.,greeting
2410,2410,we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.,greeting
2411,2411,"oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn't our waiter.",greeting
2412,2412,"we can give him five more minutes, and then leave.",greeting
2413,2413,i'll go up front and talk to the manager.,greeting
2414,2414,that's a good idea.,greeting
2415,2415,maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.,greeting
2416,2416,maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.,greeting
2417,2417,"every time we eat out, it's an adventure.",greeting
2418,2418,"last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.",greeting
2419,2419,is this table okay?,greeting
2420,2420,"no, it's too close to the kitchen door.",greeting
2421,2421,how about this table?,greeting
2422,2422,"no, it's too close to the front door.",greeting
2423,2423,this looks like a nice table.,greeting
2424,2424,"no, it's too close to the salad bar.",greeting
2425,2425,"okay, i give up.",greeting
2426,2426,"well, there is one good table.",greeting
2427,2427,great. which one?,greeting
2428,2428,i don't believe the art world.,greeting
2429,2429,what is it this time?,greeting
2430,2430,an andy warhol drawing.,greeting
2431,2431,he's a famous artist.,greeting
2432,2432,he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.,greeting
2433,2433,did he sign it?,greeting
2434,2434,yes.,greeting
2435,2435,is it beautiful?,greeting
2436,2436,it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!,greeting
2437,2437,so it's not worth much?,greeting
2438,2438,"only about $30,000.",greeting
2439,2439,can we go to the baseball game?,greeting
2440,2440,of course.,greeting
2441,2441,i love baseball.,greeting
2442,2442,so do i.,greeting
2443,2443,i love to eat the peanuts.,greeting
2444,2444,i love to eat the hot dogs.,greeting
2445,2445,i hope we'll see a home run.,greeting
2446,2446,i hope we'll catch a foul ball.,greeting
2447,2447,bring a jacket.,greeting
2448,2448,yes. it gets a little cool at night.,greeting
2449,2449,bring a glove to catch a foul ball.,greeting
2450,2450,golf is a silly game.,greeting
2451,2451,it certainly is.,greeting
2452,2452,you hit a white ball.,greeting
2453,2453,and then you chase it.,greeting
2454,2454,and then you hit it again.,greeting
2455,2455,"finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.",greeting
2456,2456,"you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.",greeting
2457,2457,what's the point?,greeting
2458,2458,how can it be fun?,greeting
2459,2459,they pay money to play this silly game!,greeting
2460,2460,i think golfers have a mental problem.,greeting
2461,2461,do you want to go fishing?,greeting
2462,2462,yes. that's a good idea.,greeting
2463,2463,where do you want to go?,greeting
2464,2464,we can go to the river.,greeting
2465,2465,or we can go to the lake.,greeting
2466,2466,or we can go to the ocean.,greeting
2467,2467,let's go to the lake.,greeting
2468,2468,yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.,greeting
2469,2469,we can be there in 20 minutes.,greeting
2470,2470,i'll get our fishing rods.,greeting
2471,2471,i'll get the bait.,greeting
2472,2472,baseball is fun.,greeting
2473,2473,i like to hit the ball.,greeting
2474,2474,i like to run around the bases.,greeting
2475,2475,i like to slide into the bases.,greeting
2476,2476,yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide.,greeting
2477,2477,i want to be a baseball player when i grow up.,greeting
2478,2478,me too. i want to play for the yankees.,greeting
2479,2479,not me. i want to play for the dodgers.,greeting
2480,2480,we have to practice every day.,greeting
2481,2481,i don't like practice.,greeting
2482,2482,me neither. it's boring.,greeting
2483,2483,let's go jogging.,greeting
2484,2484,that's a good idea.,greeting
2485,2485,i bought some new shoes.,greeting
2486,2486,are they comfortable?,greeting
2487,2487,they're very comfortable.,greeting
2488,2488,how much were they?,greeting
2489,2489,they were on sale for $80.,greeting
2490,2490,do they help you run faster?,greeting
2491,2491,"no, but my feet don't hurt anymore.",greeting
2492,2492,then they're worth every penny.,greeting
2493,2493,you might want to buy a pair.,greeting
2494,2494,tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.,greeting
2495,2495,you can say that again.,greeting
2496,2496,but i'm worried about tiger.,greeting
2497,2497,why is that?,greeting
2498,2498,because he likes to scuba dive.,greeting
2499,2499,what's wrong with that?,greeting
2500,2500,it can be dangerous.,greeting
2501,2501,you mean he could drown.,greeting
2502,2502,he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires.,greeting
2503,2503,but he dives to relax.,greeting
2504,2504,"he might relax, but it makes me nervous.",greeting
2505,2505,did you watch that golf tournament?,greeting
2506,2506,the one that tiger won?,greeting
2507,2507,how did he do it?,greeting
2508,2508,it was nothing for him.,greeting
2509,2509,he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!,greeting
2510,2510,he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.,greeting
2511,2511,i think he is from outer space.,greeting
2512,2512,no human could possibly play golf that well.,greeting
2513,2513,"whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.",greeting
2514,2514,no human can do that.,greeting
2515,2515,somebody should check his birth record.,greeting
2516,2516,who's the greatest baseball player?,greeting
2517,2517,there are so many great players.,greeting
2518,2518,"yes, but who is the greatest?",greeting
2519,2519,i'd have to say babe ruth.,greeting
2520,2520,most people would say that.,greeting
2521,2521,he changed the game.,greeting
2522,2522,"yes, he made the home run popular.",greeting
2523,2523,"everybody loved him, all over the nation.",greeting
2524,2524,he helped make the yankees the best team ever.,greeting
2525,2525,"and ruth was a good person, too.",greeting
2526,2526,he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.,greeting
2527,2527,did you hear what happened at the baseball game?,greeting
2528,2528,"no, please tell me.",greeting
2529,2529,someone punched out someone.,greeting
2530,2530,that's not nice.,greeting
2531,2531,it's worse than that.,greeting
2532,2532,how so?,greeting
2533,2533,two guys got into an argument.,greeting
2534,2534,i'll bet they were drinking.,greeting
2535,2535,a third guy punched one of the two guys.,greeting
2536,2536,"i'll bet he was drinking, too.",greeting
2537,2537,the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.,greeting
2538,2538,i want to go to the ball game.,greeting
2539,2539,is there a game tonight?,greeting
2540,2540,"yes, it starts at 7 p.m.",greeting
2541,2541,can we get tickets?,greeting
2542,2542,"yes, but only the cheap tickets.",greeting
2543,2543,how much are they?,greeting
2544,2544,they're only $5 each.,greeting
2545,2545,that's a good price.,greeting
2546,2546,"yes, it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.",greeting
2547,2547,where are the seats?,greeting
2548,2548,they're behind the outfield.,greeting
2549,2549,golf is so hard.,greeting
2550,2550,what's so hard about hitting a little white ball?,greeting
2551,2551,it's hard if you want to do it right.,greeting
2552,2552,you mean like tiger?,greeting
2553,2553,"no, like a good amateur golfer.",greeting
2554,2554,what's so hard about golf?,greeting
2555,2555,there are so many things you have to do right.,greeting
2556,2556,like what?,greeting
2557,2557,"like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.",greeting
2558,2558,yikes! who can remember all that?,greeting
2559,2559,you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.,greeting
2560,2560,did you hear about the ball player?,greeting
2561,2561,the home run hitter on drugs?,greeting
2562,2562,he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.,greeting
2563,2563,he said he wasn't using drugs.,greeting
2564,2564,he apologized to the fans.,greeting
2565,2565,the league suspended him for 50 games.,greeting
2566,2566,that will cost him some money.,greeting
2567,2567,"yes, about $7 million.",greeting
2568,2568,that will teach him a good lesson.,greeting
2569,2569,he probably won't use drugs anymore.,greeting
2570,2570,but it won't stop other players from using drugs.,greeting
2571,2571,why is there so much crime?,greeting
2572,2572,because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.,greeting
2573,2573,is that it?,greeting
2574,2574,"also, there aren't enough police.",greeting
2575,2575,but there are a lot of police.,greeting
2576,2576,there's only one police officer per 100 criminals.,greeting
2577,2577,can't we hire more police?,greeting
2578,2578,no. it costs too much money.,greeting
2579,2579,doesn't crime cost more than police?,greeting
2580,2580,"yes, it does.",greeting
2581,2581,so it would be cheaper to hire more police?,greeting
2582,2582,this is a great neighborhood.,greeting
2583,2583,"yes, it is.",greeting
2584,2584,people are friendly.,greeting
2585,2585,"yes, they are.",greeting
2586,2586,the streets and sidewalks are clean.,greeting
2587,2587,"yes, they are.",greeting
2588,2588,there's a real nice park nearby.,greeting
2589,2589,"yes, there is.",greeting
2590,2590,i feel safe here.,greeting
2591,2591,there is no crime here.,greeting
2592,2592,i wish i could move here.,greeting
2593,2593,the house burned down.,greeting
2594,2594,what happened?,greeting
2595,2595,the man fell asleep.,greeting
2596,2596,was he smoking?,greeting
2597,2597,"yes, he was smoking a cigarette.",greeting
2598,2598,did he die?,greeting
2599,2599,"yes, he did. his cat died, too.",greeting
2600,2600,that's too bad. what about his smoke alarm?,greeting
2601,2601,the battery was dead.,greeting
2602,2602,a good battery would have saved his life.,greeting
2603,2603,"he had cigarettes, but no battery.",greeting
2604,2604,they say he has started fifteen big fires.,greeting
2605,2605,he's been in jail three times already.,greeting
2606,2606,why did they ever let him out?,greeting
2607,2607,it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.,greeting
2608,2608,why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires.,greeting
2609,2609,i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.,greeting
2610,2610,but his latest fire killed someone.,greeting
2611,2611,this time they have charged him with murder.,greeting
2612,2612,so maybe he'll go to jail forever?,greeting
2613,2613,i sure hope so.,greeting
2614,2614,someone should set him on fire.,greeting
2615,2615,put your seatbelt on.,greeting
2616,2616,why?,greeting
2617,2617,because it will protect you in case of an accident.,greeting
2618,2618,but it's uncomfortable.,greeting
2619,2619,it's the law.,greeting
2620,2620,it's so much trouble.,greeting
2621,2621,it's common sense.,greeting
2622,2622,it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.,greeting
2623,2623,hold your breath till we get there.,greeting
2624,2624,"okay, my seatbelt is on.",greeting
2625,2625,i'm glad you don't complain very much.,greeting
2626,2626,what are you doing?,greeting
2627,2627,i'm going to change the light bulb. it burnt out.,greeting
2628,2628,what are you standing on?,greeting
2629,2629,a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.,greeting
2630,2630,are you crazy?,greeting
2631,2631,what's the matter?,greeting
2632,2632,those books will slip and you'll fall.,greeting
2633,2633,it's only a couple of feet.,greeting
2634,2634,"what if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?",greeting
2635,2635,i never thought about that.,greeting
2636,2636,you'd be blind for the rest of your life!,greeting
2637,2637,did you see that puddle of water on the floor?,greeting
2638,2638,yes. i called for a clean-up.,greeting
2639,2639,a puddle of water is very dangerous.,greeting
2640,2640,it isn't easy to see.,greeting
2641,2641,but it's real easy to slip on.,greeting
2642,2642,especially on these slick floors.,greeting
2643,2643,someone who slips could hurt their back.,greeting
2644,2644,they could even crack their head open.,greeting
2645,2645,we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.,greeting
2646,2646,we can leave if we put an orange cone here.,greeting
2647,2647,"yes, but i don't know where the orange cones are.",greeting
2648,2648,what happens when the fire alarm rings?,greeting
2649,2649,we tell our students to leave the classroom.,greeting
2650,2650,can they take their belongings?,greeting
2651,2651,"yes, if they do it quickly.",greeting
2652,2652,where do the students go?,greeting
2653,2653,they go out to the north parking lot.,greeting
2654,2654,what do the teachers do?,greeting
2655,2655,we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.,greeting
2656,2656,why do you do that?,greeting
2657,2657,we want to make sure all the students are out of the building.,greeting
2658,2658,"if they are all outside, then what?",greeting
2659,2659,i have to go back upstairs.,greeting
2660,2660,why? we're already late.,greeting
2661,2661,i have to check the stove.,greeting
2662,2662,what's the matter?,greeting
2663,2663,maybe i left the burner on.,greeting
2664,2664,"no, you didn't. i checked the stove before we left.",greeting
2665,2665,are you sure?,greeting
2666,2666,of course i'm sure.,greeting
2667,2667,"well, i have to go back upstairs anyway.",greeting
2668,2668,it's getting later every minute.,greeting
2669,2669,i think i left the water running.,greeting
2670,2670,the city is buying guns.,greeting

2672,2672,"up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked.",greeting
2673,2673,why are they doing this?,greeting
2674,2674,they want to get guns off the street.,greeting
2675,2675,who would turn in a gun for $200?,greeting
2676,2676,that isn't a good deal?,greeting
2677,2677,a good gun costs $400 or more.,greeting
2678,2678,"well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400.",greeting
2679,2679,i'll keep my receipt and my gun.,greeting
2680,2680,i didn't know you had a gun.,greeting
2681,2681,you're yawning.,greeting
2682,2682,i sure am.,greeting
2683,2683,you should go to bed.,greeting
2684,2684,i will as soon as i finish this article.,greeting
2685,2685,what are you reading?,greeting
2686,2686,it's about crime in los angeles.,greeting
2687,2687,what does it say?,greeting
2688,2688,the mayor says the crime rate is going down.,greeting
2689,2689,then why does everyone lock their doors?,greeting
2690,2690,i guess they haven't read this article.,greeting
2691,2691,no one believes that the crime rate is going down.,greeting
2692,2692,people who live in california are crazy.,greeting
2693,2693,why is that?,greeting
2694,2694,because of all the earthquakes and fires.,greeting
2695,2695,but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.,greeting
2696,2696,once in a while is once too many.,greeting
2697,2697,but you're right. there are a lot of fires.,greeting
2698,2698,a recent fire destroyed 85 homes.,greeting
2699,2699,"still, it's safer than florida.",greeting
2700,2700,florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.,greeting
2701,2701,"no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october.",greeting
2702,2702,but most of those hurricanes are harmless.,greeting

2735,2735,i want sheets without stains on them.,greeting
2736,2736,what time does your plane leave?,greeting
2737,2737,it leaves at 12:15.,greeting
2738,2738,when do you have to be at the airport?,greeting
2739,2739,i have to be there two hours early.,greeting
2740,2740,so we have to be at the airport at 10:15.,greeting
2741,2741,that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.,greeting
2742,2742,"well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.",greeting
2743,2743,so maybe we better leave at 8:15?,greeting
2744,2744,"yes, it's better to get there too early than too late.",greeting
2745,2745,i agree.,greeting
2746,2746,you never know what might happen on these freeways.,greeting

2752,2752,"no, i'm not. it's march. time is running out. seats are selling out right now.",greeting
2753,2753,i thought i would wait until october.,greeting
2754,2754,i'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during christmas.,greeting
2755,2755,you're right.,greeting
2756,2756,"well, listen to me. you need to buy a ticket now.",greeting
2757,2757,but maybe prices will be cheaper in october.,greeting
2758,2758,i hate flying.,greeting

2760,2760,"a long time ago, flying used to be okay.",greeting

2997,2997,you put all your eggs into one basket.,greeting
2998,2998,"if the company goes out of business, i'll have nothing.",greeting
2999,2999,i was going to be a doctor.,greeting
3000,3000,what happened to your plans?,greeting
3001,3001,i got a d in college chemistry.,greeting
3002,3002,"well, a d is better than an f.",greeting
3003,3003,a tutor helped me get the d!,greeting
3004,3004,"so, you didn't become a doctor.",greeting
3005,3005,and now i'm glad that i didn't.,greeting
3006,3006,why's that?,greeting
3007,3007,a hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.,greeting
3008,3008,"oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.",greeting
3009,3009,"if you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals.",greeting
3010,3010,i want to be a mail carrier when i grow up.,greeting
3011,3011,why?,greeting
3012,3012,because you get to meet a lot of people.,greeting
3013,3013,you sure do.,greeting
3014,3014,and you get a lot of exercise every day.,greeting
3015,3015,that's the truth.,greeting
3016,3016,and you get to play with a lot of dogs.,greeting
3017,3017,"well, you're supposed to be working.",greeting
3018,3018,"yes, but i will always pet the friendly dogs.",greeting
3019,3019,what about the unfriendly dogs?,greeting
3020,3020,"i think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.",greeting
3021,3021,i want to move to new york.,greeting
3022,3022,to the state or the city?,greeting
3023,3023,"to the city, of course.",greeting
3024,3024,why do you want to move there?,greeting
3025,3025,because i want to make a lot of money.,greeting
3026,3026,there are a lot of poor people in new york.,greeting
3027,3027,there sure areÂ—at least a million.,greeting
3028,3028,so how do you plan to become rich?,greeting
3029,3029,i will knock on the doors of all the corporations.,greeting
3030,3030,that won't make you rich. nobody will talk to you.,greeting
3031,3031,i will keep knocking on doors.,greeting
3032,3032,i love salads.,greeting
3033,3033,me too.,greeting
3034,3034,i usually eat a simple salad.,greeting
3035,3035,what do you put in it?,greeting
3036,3036,"just lettuce, tomato, and celery.",greeting
3037,3037,that's it?,greeting
3038,3038,i add some pepper and salt.,greeting
3039,3039,i always put cheese in my salads.,greeting
3040,3040,"yes, cheese is nice.",greeting
3041,3041,what kind of dressing do you use?,greeting
3042,3042,i pour lots of french dressing on top.,greeting
3043,3043,i love cheese.,greeting
3044,3044,me too.,greeting
3045,3045,where does cheese come from?,greeting
3046,3046,it comes from cows.,greeting
3047,3047,"so we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?",greeting
3048,3048,"yes, we do.",greeting
3049,3049,what else do we get from cows?,greeting
3050,3050,we get hamburgers and steak.,greeting
3051,3051,"oh, that's so delicious.",greeting
3052,3052,we also get leather.,greeting
3053,3053,"we get a lot of things from cows, don't we?",greeting
3054,3054,i used to work in a deli.,greeting
3055,3055,how did you like it?,greeting
3056,3056,i loved it!,greeting
3057,3057,did you get free food?,greeting
3058,3058,i ate free cheese and meat every day.,greeting
3059,3059,that sounds like a great job.,greeting
3060,3060,"whatever a customer ordered, i sliced off a little more for me.",greeting
3061,3061,did you get fat?,greeting
3062,3062,"no, but i did put on a few pounds.",greeting
3063,3063,that sounds like a dream job.,greeting
3064,3064,"it was, until one day my manager caught me.",greeting
3065,3065,i'm on a new diet.,greeting
3066,3066,what are you eating now?,greeting
3067,3067,i switched from pasta to potatoes.,greeting
3068,3068,why did you do that?,greeting
3069,3069,pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food.,greeting
3070,3070,natural food has more vitamins.,greeting
3071,3071,and it's just as easy to prepare.,greeting
3072,3072,how do you prepare the potatoes?,greeting
3073,3073,"i wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.",greeting
3074,3074,that's pretty simple.,greeting
3075,3075,"then i add butter, salt, and pepper.",greeting
3076,3076,my girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.,greeting
3077,3077,why was that?,greeting
3078,3078,i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it.,greeting
3079,3079,what's the matter with that?,greeting
3080,3080,her mom is a great cook.,greeting
3081,3081,"so, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.",greeting
3082,3082,it hurt her feelings.,greeting
3083,3083,oh.,greeting
3084,3084,"i apologized to her, but i could tell she was still upset.",greeting
3085,3085,maybe you shouldn't eat there again.,greeting
3086,3086,i'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.,greeting
3087,3087,i eat the same thing every day.,greeting
3088,3088,you're kidding.,greeting
3089,3089,"no, i'm serious.",greeting
3090,3090,doesn't that get old?,greeting
3091,3091,"no, because i'm eating food that i like.",greeting
3092,3092,but the same thing day after day gets old.,greeting
3093,3093,"well, i guess if it ever does get old, i'll change to something different.",greeting
3094,3094,do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?,greeting
3095,3095,"no, i hate vegetables.",greeting
3096,3096,but you eat fruits.,greeting
3097,3097,"i eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.",greeting
3098,3098,there's something wrong with my orange.,greeting
3099,3099,what's wrong?,greeting
3100,3100,it's not orange!,greeting
3101,3101,your orange isn't orange?,greeting
3102,3102,"no, it's dark pink!",greeting
3103,3103,are you sure? i never heard of such a thing.,greeting
3104,3104,"i just peeled it, and i'm looking at it right now.",greeting
3105,3105,"let me see. yes, you're right. your orange is pink.",greeting
3106,3106,who ever heard of such a thing?,greeting
3107,3107,"oh, look. here's the little sticker that was on it. it's called a pink navel.",greeting
3108,3108,what is this world coming to?,greeting
3109,3109,i love peanuts.,greeting
3110,3110,"me, too. i love them roasted and salted.",greeting
3111,3111,i love boiled peanuts.,greeting
3112,3112,boiled? i never heard of that.,greeting
3113,3113,just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.,greeting
3114,3114,i'll have to try them sometime.,greeting
3115,3115,they're best when they're hot.,greeting
3116,3116,my brother is allergic to peanuts.,greeting
3117,3117,that's not good.,greeting
3118,3118,"no, it isn't. he almost died when he was little.",greeting
3119,3119,i guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.,greeting
3120,3120,i'm gaining weight.,greeting
3121,3121,how much have you gained?,greeting
3122,3122,three pounds just this month.,greeting
3123,3123,do you know why?,greeting
3124,3124,i think it's the ice cream.,greeting
3125,3125,you started eating ice cream?,greeting
3126,3126,it was on sale.,greeting
3127,3127,how much did you buy?,greeting
3128,3128,i filled up my freezer with ice cream.,greeting
3129,3129,"well, it won't last forever.",greeting
3130,3130,"no, i figure i'll finish it all by next week.",greeting
3131,3131,i'm stuffed.,greeting
3132,3132,of course you are. you ate everything on the table.,greeting
3133,3133,i don't like to eat leftovers.,greeting
3134,3134,i'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.,greeting
3135,3135,i like my food hot and fresh.,greeting
3136,3136,you like to see it disappear.,greeting
3137,3137,i don't like it reheated.,greeting
3138,3138,"well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.",greeting
3139,3139,i'm so full i'm going to burst.,greeting
3140,3140,you should loosen your belt.,greeting
3141,3141,i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.,greeting
3142,3142,i saw what you did.,greeting
3143,3143,i didn't do anything.,greeting
3144,3144,"oh yes, you did.",greeting
3145,3145,what are you talking about?,greeting
3146,3146,you know what i'm talking about.,greeting
3147,3147,i don't have any idea.,greeting
3148,3148,you know what you did.,greeting
3149,3149,"maybe i know, but how could you know?",greeting
3150,3150,because i was watching you.,greeting
3151,3151,"okay, i'm sorry i did it.",greeting
3152,3152,don't drink milk out of the carton. use a glass!,greeting
3153,3153,i like that shirt.,greeting
3154,3154,so do i.,greeting
3155,3155,how much is it?,greeting
3156,3156,i don't know. the tag is missing.,greeting
3157,3157,ask the clerk.,greeting
3158,3158,i will.,greeting
3159,3159,"oh, look. here's another shirt just like it.",greeting
3160,3160,does it have a price tag?,greeting
3161,3161,"yes, it does. it's only $20.",greeting
3162,3162,that's a great price.,greeting
3163,3163,i think i'll buy both of them.,greeting
3164,3164,i bought you a pair of pants.,greeting
3165,3165,thank you.,greeting
3166,3166,i hope they fit.,greeting
3167,3167,i hope you kept the receipt.,greeting
3168,3168,you think they won't fit?,greeting
3169,3169,i think i've put on some weight.,greeting
3170,3170,you think?,greeting
3171,3171,maybe a pound or two.,greeting
3172,3172,maybe four or five pounds?,greeting
3173,3173,my waist is bigger than it was.,greeting
3174,3174,no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband.,greeting
3175,3175,what do we need to buy?,greeting
3176,3176,let me look at our list.,greeting
3177,3177,i know that we need milk.,greeting
3178,3178,nonfat.,greeting
3179,3179,of course. what else?,greeting
3180,3180,"we need cheese, bread, and ham.",greeting
3181,3181,what kind of cheese?,greeting
3182,3182,swiss.,greeting
3183,3183,"of course, the cheese with holes in it.",greeting
3184,3184,i never used to buy swiss cheese.,greeting
3185,3185,why not?,greeting
3186,3186,i need some pants.,greeting
3187,3187,i thought you just bought a pair.,greeting
3188,3188,i did.,greeting
3189,3189,what's wrong with them so soon?,greeting
3190,3190,"the pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.",greeting
3191,3191,you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.,greeting
3192,3192,but that's what pockets are for.,greeting
3193,3193,you should carry them in a purse.,greeting
3194,3194,"i'm a man, and men don't carry purses!",greeting
3195,3195,"well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.",greeting
3196,3196,i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.,greeting
3197,3197,what are those wipes for?,greeting
3198,3198,you use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.,greeting
3199,3199,that's a great idea.,greeting
3200,3200,"yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.",greeting
3201,3201,i'm going to take five wipes.,greeting
3202,3202,what do you need five of them for?,greeting
3203,3203,"one to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.",greeting
3204,3204,what's the matter with the produce?,greeting
3205,3205,do you think the bananas fell from the sky?,greeting
3206,3206,what do you mean?,greeting
3207,3207,"i mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.",greeting
3208,3208,did you go to the 99 cents store?,greeting
3209,3209,"yes, i did.",greeting

3211,3211,"well, i got a lot of good deals, as usual.",greeting
3212,3212,like what?,greeting
3213,3213,"well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.",greeting
3214,3214,that's a good deal.,greeting
3215,3215,and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.,greeting
3216,3216,another good deal.,greeting
3217,3217,but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.,greeting
3218,3218,i don't know how that store makes money.,greeting
3219,3219,i need a new computer.,greeting
3220,3220,what's the matter with yours?,greeting
3221,3221,it's six years old.,greeting

3223,3223,"it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity.",greeting
3224,3224,are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?,greeting
3225,3225,"oh, a laptop, of course.",greeting
3226,3226,a pc or a mac?,greeting
3227,3227,i haven't decided yet.,greeting
3228,3228,more and more people are using macs.,greeting
3229,3229,but 90 percent of the world uses pcs.,greeting
3230,3230,i got ripped off.,greeting
3231,3231,what happened?,greeting
3232,3232,"i had a car problem, so i went online.",greeting
3233,3233,did you find a solution?,greeting
3234,3234,"yes, i did. a site i went to said they would send me the solution.",greeting
3235,3235,"so, what's the problem?",greeting
3236,3236,"i sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.",greeting

3238,3238,i sent them an email asking for my money back.,greeting

3240,3240,not yet. it's been a week.,greeting
3241,3241,where's the pencil sharpener?,greeting
3242,3242,which one?,greeting
3243,3243,any one. i need to sharpen this pencil.,greeting
3244,3244,i think there's one on the dining room table.,greeting
3245,3245,i already looked there.,greeting
3246,3246,did you look in the desk drawer?,greeting
3247,3247,"yes, i looked there, too.",greeting
3248,3248,don't we have about five sharpeners?,greeting
3249,3249,"yes, but they seem to have legs.",greeting
3250,3250,tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener.,greeting
3251,3251,get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.,greeting
3252,3252,i'm trying to stretch my dollars.,greeting
3253,3253,how are you doing that?,greeting
3254,3254,i started shopping at the dollar store.,greeting
3255,3255,that saves a lot of money.,greeting
3256,3256,i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.,greeting
3257,3257,that's a good deal.,greeting
3258,3258,"yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.",greeting
3259,3259,just put them in the fridge.,greeting
3260,3260,"also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.",greeting
3261,3261,why did you do that?,greeting
3262,3262,i mixed them together.,greeting
3263,3263,i really like this house.,greeting
3264,3264,can we afford it?,greeting
3265,3265,they want 20 percent down.,greeting
3266,3266,that's a lot of money.,greeting
3267,3267,but the house is so nice.,greeting
3268,3268,it's in a great neighborhood.,greeting
3269,3269,it's close to the beach.,greeting
3270,3270,it's close to the freeways.,greeting
3271,3271,it's got a big yard.,greeting
3272,3272,"the kids love the house, too.",greeting
3273,3273,"if we don't buy it, someone else will.",greeting
3274,3274,we can't afford this house.,greeting
3275,3275,are you sure?,greeting
3276,3276,"we will be house rich, but cash poor.",greeting
3277,3277,what do you mean?,greeting
3278,3278,our monthly payments will be too high.,greeting
3279,3279,we won't have any money for other things?,greeting
3280,3280,"no, we won't have money for gas or food.",greeting
3281,3281,we'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?,greeting
3282,3282,without the peanut butter!,greeting
3283,3283,that's no good!,greeting
3284,3284,we have to find a cheaper house.,greeting
3285,3285,that is a beautiful house.,greeting
3286,3286,i don't like it.,greeting
3287,3287,what's the matter with it?,greeting
3288,3288,it's on the corner.,greeting
3289,3289,so?,greeting
3290,3290,that means it gets twice as much traffic.,greeting
3291,3291,you're right.,greeting
3292,3292,"when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.",greeting
3293,3293,or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.,greeting
3294,3294,or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.,greeting
3295,3295,let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.,greeting
3296,3296,i hate looking for an apartment.,greeting
3297,3297,"me, too.",greeting
3298,3298,we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street.,greeting
3299,3299,we'd better get ready to go.,greeting
3300,3300,it's an upstairs unit.,greeting
3301,3301,"that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet.",greeting
3302,3302,and it's a corner unit.,greeting
3303,3303,that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us.,greeting
3304,3304,no pets are allowed.,greeting
3305,3305,perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.,greeting
3306,3306,and there are only six units in the whole building.,greeting
3307,3307,did you call the manager?,greeting
3308,3308,yes. he said he'd come over tomorrow.,greeting
3309,3309,did he say what time?,greeting
3310,3310,yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.,greeting
3311,3311,did he understand what the problem is?,greeting
3312,3312,yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work.,greeting
3313,3313,it shouldn't take him long to fix it.,greeting
3314,3314,i don't even know why we need to fix it.,greeting
3315,3315,in case we have visitors.,greeting
3316,3316,but they can just knock on the door.,greeting
3317,3317,"actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too.",greeting
3318,3318,do you like this house?,greeting
3319,3319,"yes, it's beautiful.",greeting
3320,3320,it's perfect for us and the kids.,greeting
3321,3321,"three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.",greeting
3322,3322,and we can afford it!,greeting
3323,3323,so are we going to buy it?,greeting
3324,3324,i'm afraid not.,greeting
3325,3325,"it's too far from your job, isn't it?",greeting
3326,3326,i can't spend four hours on the road every day.,greeting
3327,3327,"by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.",greeting
3328,3328,i won't be able to play with the kids.,greeting
3329,3329,"boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?",greeting
3330,3330,it sure is.,greeting
3331,3331,"in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.",greeting
3332,3332,let's turn on the heat.,greeting
3333,3333,i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.,greeting
3334,3334,it should be warmer in a few minutes.,greeting
3335,3335,it's so nice to have a heated apartment.,greeting
3336,3336,how did they survive in the old days?,greeting
3337,3337,they had fireplaces.,greeting
3338,3338,someone had to chop the wood.,greeting
3339,3339,and carry it into the house.,greeting
3340,3340,this is a nice neighborhood.,greeting
3341,3341,the streets are clean and quiet.,greeting
3342,3342,the neighbors don't party on the weekends.,greeting
3343,3343,people take care of their lawns.,greeting
3344,3344,no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.,greeting
3345,3345,we never have to call the police about anything.,greeting
3346,3346,our kids are completely safe.,greeting
3347,3347,so why are we selling our house?,greeting
3348,3348,they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.,greeting
3349,3349,so we've got to sell before property values go down?,greeting
3350,3350,yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building.,greeting
3351,3351,that was a huge fire in santa barbara.,greeting
3352,3352,"yes, it was.",greeting
3353,3353,they said about 30 houses burned to the ground.,greeting
3354,3354,and they were expensive houses.,greeting
3355,3355,i feel so sorry for those people.,greeting
3356,3356,why feel sorry for rich people?,greeting
3357,3357,i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.,greeting
3358,3358,"so do i, but not if they're rich.",greeting
3359,3359,what does that have to do with it?,greeting
3360,3360,rich people think they're better than us.,greeting
3361,3361,how many rich people do you know?,greeting
3362,3362,bears are invading our neighborhoods.,greeting
3363,3363,of course they are. they're starving to death.,greeting
3364,3364,they should stay in the woods where they belong.,greeting
3365,3365,there's no food in the woods.,greeting
3366,3366,can't they eat grass?,greeting
3367,3367,do you think a bear is a cow?,greeting
3368,3368,"well, i've seen them eating berries.",greeting
3369,3369,berries aren't in season all year round.,greeting
3370,3370,it's too dangerous for kids and pets.,greeting
3371,3371,people need to cover their trash cans.,greeting
3372,3372,the police need to shoot all the bears.,greeting
3373,3373,who did you vote for?,greeting
3374,3374,i voted for obama.,greeting
3375,3375,me too.,greeting
3376,3376,he will be a great president.,greeting
3377,3377,everyone likes him.,greeting
3378,3378,he's a good speaker.,greeting
3379,3379,and he's really smart.,greeting
3380,3380,he will solve our problems.,greeting
3381,3381,he will end the war.,greeting
3382,3382,the next four years will be good years.,greeting
3383,3383,"i'll vote for him next time, too.",greeting
3384,3384,the election is next week.,greeting
3385,3385,who are you voting for?,greeting
3386,3386,i'm not voting for the mayor.,greeting
3387,3387,why not?,greeting
3388,3388,he made promises that he didn't keep.,greeting
3389,3389,like what?,greeting
3390,3390,"he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.",greeting
3391,3391,how many did he hire?,greeting
3392,3392,one hundred!,greeting
3393,3393,maybe he had a good reason.,greeting
3394,3394,maybe he's just a liar.,greeting
3395,3395,i can't believe he won the election.,greeting
3396,3396,only 15 percent of the voters turned out.,greeting
3397,3397,that is a joke.,greeting
3398,3398,"voting is so important, but people don't bother.",greeting
3399,3399,many people think their vote doesn't matter.,greeting
3400,3400,"the mayor won by only 2,000 votes.",greeting
3401,3401,we're stuck with him for four more years.,greeting
3402,3402,voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in.,greeting
3403,3403,all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.,greeting
3404,3404,how easy is that?,greeting
3405,3405,i guess people just don't care.,greeting
3406,3406,"well, we have a new president.",greeting
3407,3407,but we have the same old problems.,greeting
3408,3408,"well, he's made a few changes.",greeting
3409,3409,like what?,greeting
3410,3410,i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.,greeting
3411,3411,"oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court.",greeting
3412,3412,who's paying for that?,greeting
3413,3413,i think we are!,greeting
3414,3414,"well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.",greeting
3415,3415,"yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.",greeting
3416,3416,do any other world leaders have a basketball court?,greeting
3417,3417,people say that everybody loves obama.,greeting
3418,3418,"well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain.",greeting
3419,3419,that's 50 million people who don't love obama.,greeting
3420,3420,obama's got four years to make everyone happy.,greeting
3421,3421,he's never going to make everyone happy.,greeting
3422,3422,can you imagine being president?,greeting
3423,3423,everyone wants you to solve their problems.,greeting
3424,3424,i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.,greeting
3425,3425,you and everybody else.,greeting
3426,3426,i would never want to be president.,greeting
3427,3427,but think about all the power you'd have.,greeting
3428,3428,did you read this article?,greeting
3429,3429,what article?,greeting
3430,3430,it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.,greeting
3431,3431,only 11 percent?,greeting
3432,3432,about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.,greeting
3433,3433,where does he travel to?,greeting
3434,3434,"oh, all over the world.",greeting
3435,3435,but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.,greeting
3436,3436,he's visiting other cities to get ideas.,greeting
3437,3437,can't he just go online?,greeting
3438,3438,the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.,greeting
3439,3439,who did you vote for for president?,greeting
3440,3440,i voted for ralph nader.,greeting
3441,3441,who in the world is ralph nader?,greeting
3442,3442,he's the best man for president.,greeting
3443,3443,why's that?,greeting
3444,3444,he hates corporations.,greeting
3445,3445,"well, most corporations do think only about money.",greeting
3446,3446,he hates democrats and republicans.,greeting
3447,3447,"well, they do put their party before their country.",greeting
3448,3448,he's the only candidate that i trust.,greeting
3449,3449,but he didn't have a chance. nobody voted for him!,greeting
3450,3450,i don't know why i bother to vote.,greeting
3451,3451,why's that?,greeting
3452,3452,what good does it do?,greeting
3453,3453,you get to put someone in power that you like.,greeting
3454,3454,only if my candidate wins.,greeting
3455,3455,"well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.",greeting
3456,3456,"but even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.",greeting
3457,3457,that's true. they promise anything just so they get elected.,greeting
3458,3458,"and when elected, they go their own way.",greeting
3459,3459,they forget who put them in power.,greeting
3460,3460,they forget where they came from.,greeting
3461,3461,that election for u.s. senator stunk.,greeting
3462,3462,what do you mean?,greeting
3463,3463,there were more votes than voters!,greeting
3464,3464,but that's impossible.,greeting
3465,3465,officials said that it's possible.,greeting
3466,3466,did they explain how it's possible?,greeting
3467,3467,no. they said there are some things you can't explain.,greeting
3468,3468,so are they going to hold another election?,greeting
3469,3469,no. that will cost too much money.,greeting
3470,3470,so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?,greeting
3471,3471,"well, the democratic party says it was an honest election.",greeting
3472,3472,i see that former president bush is at a conference.,greeting
3473,3473,yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.,greeting
3474,3474,"yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.",greeting
3475,3475,"only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas.",greeting
3476,3476,"not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.",greeting
3477,3477,but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.,greeting
3478,3478,that's nice that he found the time to make a visit.,greeting
3479,3479,he spoke to them and made them feel better.,greeting
3480,3480,did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?,greeting
3481,3481,"no, he didn't have time to do that.",greeting
3482,3482,"well, he's got plenty of time now!",greeting
3483,3483,did you get your official sample ballot?,greeting
3484,3484,"yes, with the voter instructions.",greeting
3485,3485,how are you going to vote?,greeting
3486,3486,"same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.",greeting
3487,3487,"i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?",greeting
3488,3488,"against all of them, of course.",greeting
3489,3489,"but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.",greeting
3490,3490,we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!,greeting
3491,3491,that's true. where did that money go?,greeting
3492,3492,our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.,greeting
3493,3493,they are having a good time with our money.,greeting
3494,3494,have you decided how you are going to vote?,greeting
3495,3495,"do you mean on measures 1, 2, and 3?",greeting
3496,3496,"yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.",greeting
3497,3497,you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.,greeting
3498,3498,but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.,greeting
3499,3499,do you believe the tv ads?,greeting
3500,3500,i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.,greeting
3501,3501,"don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true.",greeting
3502,3502,"but the title of measure 1 is ""better schools at no cost.""",greeting
3503,3503,"the title should be ""better schools at huge cost.""",greeting
3504,3504,i can't believe that they would lie to us.,greeting
3505,3505,i have a stomachache.,greeting
3506,3506,is it something you ate?,greeting
3507,3507,maybe. i'm not sure.,greeting
3508,3508,what did you have for breakfast?,greeting
3509,3509,"the usual, cereal with milk and a banana.",greeting
3510,3510,maybe the milk was bad.,greeting
3511,3511,it didn't smell bad.,greeting
3512,3512,maybe the banana was bad.,greeting
3513,3513,"no, the banana was delicious.",greeting
3514,3514,maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.,greeting
3515,3515,"no, that's not the problem.",greeting
3516,3516,what's this stain?,greeting
3517,3517,i don't know.,greeting
3518,3518,it looks like blood.,greeting
3519,3519,i think my nose was bleeding.,greeting
3520,3520,you should wet your shirt immediately.,greeting
3521,3521,why?,greeting
3522,3522,because that gets the blood out of the shirt.,greeting
3523,3523,what's a little blood?,greeting
3524,3524,your white shirt is ruined.,greeting
3525,3525,"so, i'll just buy another one.",greeting
3526,3526,you can wear this one around the house.,greeting
3527,3527,my fingers hurt.,greeting
3528,3528,why do they hurt?,greeting
3529,3529,i type too much.,greeting
3530,3530,you should take a break.,greeting
3531,3531,i need to type to make money.,greeting
3532,3532,but typing is causing you pain.,greeting
3533,3533,maybe i should see a doctor.,greeting
3534,3534,doctors are too expensive.,greeting
3535,3535,he might tell me to rest for a while.,greeting
3536,3536,he might want to cut you open.,greeting
3537,3537,he might say i'm okay.,greeting
3538,3538,what did the doctor say?,greeting
3539,3539,he thinks i have too much stress.,greeting
3540,3540,stress causes your stomachaches?,greeting
3541,3541,stress causes different problems with different people.,greeting
3542,3542,so what did he tell you to do?,greeting
3543,3543,he said i need to think positive.,greeting
3544,3544,he didn't give you any medication?,greeting
3545,3545,i hate medication. it makes me feel different.,greeting
3546,3546,so how do you think positive?,greeting
3547,3547,i think about nice things.,greeting
3548,3548,like what?,greeting
3549,3549,i cut my finger.,greeting
3550,3550,how did you do that?,greeting
3551,3551,it's a paper cut.,greeting
3552,3552,paper can be dangerous.,greeting
3553,3553,"it hurts, too.",greeting
3554,3554,paper cuts can hurt a lot.,greeting
3555,3555,where are the band-aids?,greeting
3556,3556,i think they're in the medicine cabinet.,greeting
3557,3557,it's on the tip of my finger.,greeting
3558,3558,a band-aid might not work.,greeting
3559,3559,i must not use this finger until the cut heals.,greeting
3560,3560,do you smell that?,greeting
3561,3561,"oh, yes.",greeting
3562,3562,i can't stand cigarette smoke.,greeting
3563,3563,it smells so bad.,greeting
3564,3564,one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.,greeting
3565,3565,smokers think they are so cool.,greeting
3566,3566,they are so weak.,greeting
3567,3567,a little cigarette controls them.,greeting
3568,3568,they look so stupid taking a puff.,greeting
3569,3569,and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.,greeting
3570,3570,they think it's cool.,greeting
3571,3571,do you have a cold?,greeting
3572,3572,"yes, i do.",greeting
3573,3573,how did you get it?,greeting
3574,3574,my sister had a cold. she gave it to me.,greeting
3575,3575,have you taken anything for your cold?,greeting
3576,3576,"no, i just blow my nose a lot.",greeting
3577,3577,your nose is stopped up?,greeting
3578,3578,yes. i have to breathe through my mouth.,greeting
3579,3579,have you tried nose drops?,greeting
3580,3580,"no, i don't like nose drops.",greeting
3581,3581,they work great.,greeting
3582,3582,"would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?",greeting
3583,3583,sure.,greeting
3584,3584,thank you.,greeting
3585,3585,you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.,greeting
3586,3586,i want to get a tan. i don't want to look so pale.,greeting
3587,3587,what's wrong with looking pale?,greeting
3588,3588,people think you might be sick.,greeting
3589,3589,who thinks that?,greeting
3590,3590,i don't know.,greeting
3591,3591,it's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.,greeting
3592,3592,i know that.,greeting
3593,3593,i can't quit smoking.,greeting
3594,3594,of course you can.,greeting
3595,3595,i don't have enough will power.,greeting
3596,3596,of course you do.,greeting
3597,3597,i wish i had never started.,greeting
3598,3598,so does every smoker.,greeting
3599,3599,i've tried to quit so many times.,greeting
3600,3600,so has everyone else.,greeting
3601,3601,nothing seems to work.,greeting
3602,3602,"all it takes is will power, and you have it.",greeting
3603,3603,then why can't i quit?,greeting
3604,3604,my back is killing me.,greeting
3605,3605,what did you do?,greeting
3606,3606,i got out of my car.,greeting
3607,3607,that's it?,greeting
3608,3608,i injured my back one time just by sneezing.,greeting
3609,3609,you should see a doctor.,greeting
3610,3610,my doctor said i need surgery.,greeting
3611,3611,so?,greeting
3612,3612,"so, forget it.",greeting
3613,3613,you don't have the money?,greeting
3614,3614,i have no insurance.,greeting
3615,3615,my brother smokes three packs a day.,greeting
3616,3616,three packs of what?,greeting
3617,3617,"cigarettes, of course.",greeting
3618,3618,how can he do that?,greeting
3619,3619,"when he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.",greeting
3620,3620,he's a chain smoker.,greeting
3621,3621,he's been a chain smoker for 30 years.,greeting
3622,3622,that's unbelievable. can he still breathe?,greeting
3623,3623,"he can, but the people around him can't.",greeting
3624,3624,how can he still be alive?,greeting
3625,3625,his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.,greeting
3626,3626,i hate brushing my teeth.,greeting
3627,3627,it's such a chore.,greeting
3628,3628,"brush, brush. spit, spit.",greeting
3629,3629,what did they do in the old days?,greeting
3630,3630,they brushed with their fingers.,greeting
3631,3631,they also ate with their fingers!,greeting
3632,3632,why do they call it the good old days?,greeting
3633,3633,maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.,greeting
3634,3634,who invented flossing?,greeting
3635,3635,"a dentist, i'm sure.",greeting
3636,3636,i hate flossing more than brushing!,greeting
3637,3637,let's stop for a while. i need a break and some water.,greeting
3638,3638,this trail is hard to climb.,greeting
3639,3639,especially on a hot day like this.,greeting
3640,3640,i can't believe we haven't seen any animals.,greeting
3641,3641,thank goodness! i don't want to see any wild animals.,greeting
3642,3642,all we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.,greeting
3643,3643,"we're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.",greeting
3644,3644,i bet i've lost a couple of pounds already.,greeting
3645,3645,all you've lost is some sweat.,greeting
3646,3646,i haven't even lost one pound of fat?,greeting
3647,3647,"if you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.",greeting
3648,3648,"oh no, another pimple on my face.",greeting
3649,3649,pimples suck.,greeting
3650,3650,it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day.,greeting
3651,3651,maybe it's something in your diet.,greeting
3652,3652,"no, i eat the same things day after day.",greeting
3653,3653,then maybe it's in your genes.,greeting
3654,3654,you might be right.,greeting
3655,3655,do pimples run in your family?,greeting
3656,3656,not that i've noticed.,greeting
3657,3657,"well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.",greeting
3658,3658,"whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face.",greeting
3659,3659,do you believe everything you hear?,greeting
3660,3660,i don't believe anything i don't see with my own eyes.,greeting
3661,3661,you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio.,greeting
3662,3662,you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.,greeting
3663,3663,everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.,greeting
3664,3664,three different people will give you three different stories.,greeting
3665,3665,and the government will give you a fourth story.,greeting
3666,3666,"yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.",greeting
3667,3667,but the swine flu just killed 20 people in mexico.,greeting
3668,3668,the government says we have nothing to worry about.,greeting
3669,3669,then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?,greeting
3670,3670,don't pick your nose.,greeting
3671,3671,i wasn't picking my nose.,greeting
3672,3672,what were you doing?,greeting
3673,3673,i was scratching my nose.,greeting
3674,3674,i think i know the difference between picking and scratching.,greeting
3675,3675,"okay, mom, maybe i was picking it a little bit.",greeting
3676,3676,use a tissue next time.,greeting
3677,3677,i didn't have a tissue.,greeting
3678,3678,then wait till you find a tissue.,greeting
3679,3679,i couldn't wait. it was an emergency.,greeting
3680,3680,"oh, really? maybe you should have called 911.",greeting
3681,3681,our tv remote is filthy.,greeting
3682,3682,"yes, it's covered with crud.",greeting

3685,3685,i'll use a damp cloth.,greeting
3686,3686,don't let water get into any of the cracks.,greeting
3687,3687,i'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.,greeting
3688,3688,don't rub the numbers off the remote.,greeting
3689,3689,i will rub gently but firmly.,greeting
3690,3690,"do it quickly, please, so i can change channels during commercials.",greeting
3691,3691,i'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.,greeting
3692,3692,my ear is killing me.,greeting
3693,3693,what's the matter?,greeting
3694,3694,i was on a plane.,greeting
3695,3695,so?,greeting
3696,3696,"so, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.",greeting
3697,3697,that's no good.,greeting
3698,3698,"sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.",greeting
3699,3699,have you seen a doctor?,greeting
3700,3700,i've been to two doctors.,greeting
3701,3701,and they couldn't fix your problem?,greeting
3702,3702,they both said i have to live with it.,greeting
3703,3703,did you see the woman with the new face?,greeting
3704,3704,did she get a nice job?,greeting
3705,3705,"she got an ""everything"" job!",greeting
3706,3706,what do you mean?,greeting
3707,3707,a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.,greeting
